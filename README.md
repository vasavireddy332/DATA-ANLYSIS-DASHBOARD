## GLOBAL SUPERSTORE- Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using POWER BI)
## Project Objective 
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Global Superstore dataset to analyze sales, profit, customer segments, and regional performance.
This project highlights key trends, top-performing products/markets, and loss-making areas through dynamic KPIs, slicers, and visual reports.
## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/vasavireddy332/DATA-ANLYSIS-DASHBOARD/blob/main/Global%20Superstore.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
- What are the total sales, total profit, and return margin of the Global Super Store?
- Which region has the highest sales and which has the lowest sales?
- Which region generates the highest profit in the business?
- Which category has the highest sales contribution (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies)?
- Which category has the maximum returns and how do returns differ by category?
- How does discount impact profit across different categories?
- What is the sales and profit trend year-wise from 2012 to 2015?
- Which regions show high sales but low profit, indicating possible loss or inefficiency?

## Project Insights
- Technology category contributes the highest sales, while Office Supplies and Furniture show varying performance.
- Western Europe leads in both sales and profit, making it the top-performing region.
- Returns are highest in Office Supplies, indicating a need for quality/service improvement in that category.
- Year-wise analysis shows consistent growth in sales and profit from 2012 to 2015.
- Higher discount levels reduce profit, especially in certain categories, impacting overall profitability.
## Final Conclusion :
This Power BI dashboard provides a clear view of Global Superstore performance across regions, categories, and years.
The analysis helps identify top-performing areas and highlights regions/categories where returns and discounts are affecting profit, supporting better business decision-making.
