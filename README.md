## GLOBAL SUPERSTORE- Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using POWER BI)
## Project Objective 
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Global Superstore dataset to analyze sales, profit, customer segments, and regional performance.
This project highlights key trends, top-performing products/markets, and loss-making areas through dynamic KPIs, slicers, and visual reports.
